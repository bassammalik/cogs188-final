# Extended Training Results

This document summarizes the results of our extended training session comparing different reinforcement learning approaches for the Smart Grid Energy Management project.

## Training Setup

- **Environment**: 7-day simulation with battery degradation and weather uncertainty enabled
- **Extended Training**: 300 episodes for tabular methods (Q-learning, SARSA, Monte Carlo), 100,000 timesteps for PPO
- **Evaluation**: 3 episodes for each controller

## Performance Comparison

| Controller   | Avg Reward | Avg Cost | Avg Energy Bought | Avg Energy Sold | Avg Battery SoC |
|--------------|------------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Rule-Based   | -88.36     | 88.36    | 2559.74           | 1711.45         | 2.33            |
| Forecast     | -68.12     | 68.12    | 2543.97           | 1871.38         | 0.97            |
| Q-Learning   | -71.05     | 71.05    | 2497.97           | 1768.16         | 7.23            |
| Monte-Carlo  | -59.23     | 59.23    | 2529.80           | 1840.40         | 2.89            |
| SARSA        | -70.62     | 70.62    | 2518.79           | 1779.52         | 8.03            |
| RL (PPO)     | -91.32     | 91.32    | 2569.78           | 1649.44         | 0.95            |

## Key Findings

1. **Monte Carlo** performed the best overall with the lowest average cost (59.23), demonstrating that episode-based learning may be particularly well-suited for this environment.

2. **Forecast-based** controller performed second best (68.12), showing that predictive approaches are effective for energy management.

3. **SARSA** and **Q-learning** had similar performance (70.62 and 71.05 respectively), with SARSA slightly outperforming Q-learning.

4. **PPO** (deep RL) performed worse than expected (91.32), possibly due to the complexity of the environment or the need for more training.

5. **Rule-based** controller performed relatively poorly (88.36), highlighting the benefits of learning-based approaches.

## Battery Management Strategies

- **SARSA** maintained the highest average battery state of charge (8.03 kWh)
- **Q-learning** also maintained a high battery state (7.23 kWh)
- **Monte Carlo** kept a moderate battery level (2.89 kWh)
- Other controllers maintained lower battery levels (< 2.5 kWh)

## Energy Trading Patterns

- **Forecast** and **Monte Carlo** controllers sold the most energy back to the grid
- **PPO** and **Rule-based** controllers sold the least energy
- **Q-learning** bought the least energy from the grid

## Conclusions

1. **Tabular methods outperformed deep RL** in this specific environment, possibly due to the discrete nature of the decision-making process and the relatively small state space after discretization.

2. **Monte Carlo's superior performance** suggests that learning from complete episodes provides better policy optimization for energy management than bootstrapping methods.

3. **Battery management strategy** appears to be a key differentiator between controllers, with higher-performing controllers generally maintaining moderate to high battery levels.

4. **On-policy vs. off-policy learning**: The similar performance of SARSA (on-policy) and Q-learning (off-policy) suggests that the choice between these approaches may not be critical for this particular environment.

5. **Forecast information** is valuable, as demonstrated by the strong performance of the forecast-based controller.

These results provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different reinforcement learning approaches for smart grid energy management and can guide future research and development in this area.
