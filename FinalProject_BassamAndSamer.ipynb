    "## Background\n",
    "The integration of renewable energy sources into power grids has accelerated in recent years, driven by environmental concerns and decreasing costs of technologies like solar photovoltaics[1]. However, the intermittent nature of renewable generation presents significant challenges for grid stability and energy management[2]. Microgrids—localized energy systems that can operate independently or in conjunction with the main grid—have emerged as a promising solution for integrating distributed energy resources, including renewables, storage systems, and flexible loads[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy storage systems, particularly batteries, play a crucial role in microgrids by providing flexibility to balance supply and demand[4]. Optimal battery control strategies can significantly reduce electricity costs by storing energy when prices or solar generation are high and discharging when prices are high or solar generation is low. Traditional approaches to battery control in microgrids have relied on rule-based strategies or model predictive control, which may not capture the full complexity of the environment or adapt to changing conditions[5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained attention in recent years as a promising approach for energy management in microgrids[6]. Unlike traditional optimization methods, RL can learn optimal control policies through interaction with the environment without requiring explicit models of the system dynamics. Various RL algorithms have been applied to microgrid control, including Q-learning[7], deep reinforcement learning[8], and policy gradient methods[9].\n",
    "\n",
    "However, comparative analyses of different RL approaches for microgrid energy management are limited, particularly regarding the performance of tabular methods versus deep RL in realistic environments with battery degradation and weather uncertainty. This project aims to fill this gap by implementing and comparing six different control strategies, including four RL approaches, in a simulated microgrid environment."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The primary problem addressed in this project is: How can we optimize battery control in a microgrid with solar generation to minimize electricity costs while accounting for realistic constraints such as battery degradation and weather uncertainty?\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is quantifiable as it can be expressed as a mathematical optimization problem: minimize the total electricity cost over a given time horizon, subject to constraints on battery capacity, charging/discharging rates, and energy balance. The cost function includes the cost of buying electricity from the grid minus the revenue from selling excess electricity back to the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is measurable through metrics such as average daily electricity cost, energy bought from/sold to the grid, and battery state of charge patterns. These metrics can be clearly observed and compared across different control strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is replicable as it occurs in any microgrid with renewable generation and storage, and our simulation framework allows for reproducible experiments with controlled parameters."

    "### Interpreting the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary finding is that tabular reinforcement learning methods, particularly Monte Carlo control, outperformed both traditional approaches and deep reinforcement learning for microgrid energy management. This is a significant result that challenges the common assumption that deep RL is always superior to tabular methods for complex control problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The superior performance of Monte Carlo can be attributed to several factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complete episode learning**: By learning from complete episodes rather than bootstrapping from estimated future values, Monte Carlo avoids the bias introduced by inaccurate value estimates in temporal difference methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Delayed reward structure**: The microgrid environment has delayed rewards where actions (charging/discharging) may only show their true value many steps later when prices change. Monte Carlo's episode-based approach captures these long-term dependencies more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Effective discretization**: Our state space discretization preserved the essential information needed for decision-making, allowing tabular methods to perform well despite the continuous nature of the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Exploration strategy**: Monte Carlo's exploration strategy may have been more effective at discovering profitable battery management policies compared to other methods."

    "4. **Simplified battery model**: Our battery degradation model, while more realistic than many studies, still simplifies the complex electrochemical processes in real batteries.\n",

    "## Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "While our project uses synthetic data and simulation, the deployment of automated energy management systems in real-world settings raises several ethical considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Equity and access**: Smart energy management technologies could disproportionately benefit wealthy consumers who can afford solar panels and battery storage, potentially exacerbating energy inequity. Policies should ensure that benefits from these technologies are shared across socioeconomic groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Privacy concerns**: Real-world implementations would involve collecting detailed energy usage data, which could reveal sensitive information about occupants' behaviors and habits. Strong data protection measures would be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Grid stability**: If many consumers adopt similar optimization strategies, it could lead to synchronized behaviors that destabilize the grid (e.g., everyone selling energy at the same high-price periods). System-level coordination mechanisms would be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reliability and safety**: Automated energy management systems must prioritize reliability and safety, ensuring that critical loads are always met and battery operations remain within safe parameters.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrated that tabular reinforcement learning methods, particularly Monte Carlo control, can effectively optimize battery management in microgrids with solar generation, outperforming both traditional rule-based approaches and more complex deep reinforcement learning methods. The Monte Carlo controller achieved a 33% cost reduction compared to the rule-based benchmark, highlighting the potential of reinforcement learning for energy management applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our findings challenge the common assumption that deep RL is always superior to tabular methods for complex control problems. In domains with structured state spaces and delayed rewards, like microgrid energy management, simpler methods with appropriate state discretization can achieve excellent performance with less computational complexity and training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The superior performance of Monte Carlo suggests that learning from complete episodes is particularly effective for capturing the long-term dependencies in energy management decisions. The strong performance of the forecast-based controller also highlights the value of predictive information in this domain.\n",

    "Future work should focus on validating these findings with real-world data, developing hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of different methods, and extending the framework to multi-objective optimization that considers factors beyond cost, such as environmental impact and battery longevity."
